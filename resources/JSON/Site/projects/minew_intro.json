Use your deductive reasoning skills to locate and mark all the hidden mines that were randomly planted in the grid at the start of the game. The numbers displayed in each cell tells you how many mines are buried in its 8 adjacent neighboring cells.\nThere are a few improvements over the original game, including hints for players who are stuck and the option to autoflag mines with dual-clicks.
