    "text": "Eat food and grow longer! In this widely popular classic arcade game, the player controls a gluttonous snake that roams freely in the open field. Given enough time, the snake will grow so long that its body will form a dynamic maze in which the player must navigate cautiously. The player beats the game if the snake fills the entire game screen.\nMy custom implementation of Snake retains the essental gameplay elements. However, the classic 8-bit pixalated graphic is replaced by smooth slitering animation, which took quite a bit of {effort} to create. I also included a bonus food system, one which dispenses food that is available for a limited duration before disappearing. If you want to see the source code, you can check it out {here}.",
